    <description>Field that stores the Status of a Member before it is set to &#39;Complete&#39; - i.e. the category of the Member if applicable.

This is useful for the Categorisation (Waves) functionality, as this will preserve the &#39;Category&#39; (Status value) of the Member before it is set to &#39;Completed&#39;.</description>
